# DM Notice

{% hint style="danger" %}
Waya is committed to providing a safe and respectful environment for all users. We do not support or tolerate any harmful or offensive content or language.
{% endhint %}

### What is this?

This is a feature that automatically sends a pre-set message to new joining members. The content of the **DM messages are determined by the server admins and is not controlled by Waya.** We do not support or tolerate any harmful or offensive content or language.

### How to remove this button?

This is a notice to inform users that it's content determined by the server admins, for safety reasons and is not able to be removed (for now).&#x20;

### How do I disable this?

To disable this feature, a server admin has to run the `/config` command and head over to **Logging > Welcomer > DM Message > Disable**. Note that this action will delete all the content of that configured message.

### How can I have this too?

1. Install Waya on your server by going to [get.waya.one](https://get.waya.one).
2. Run the `/config` command.
3. Go to **Logging > Welcomer > DM Message**.
4. 🎉 Done! Try it out with `wa greet`
