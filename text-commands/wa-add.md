## Features in words

When additional members are added to a ticket channel or thread, their inclusion will be recorded in the ticket logs. Moreover, if the option for ticket info and transcript if enabled, these members will receive a direct message (DM) containing the relevant ticket details. It's important to note that this notification and DM will only occur if the member is not being removed from the ticket afterwards.
