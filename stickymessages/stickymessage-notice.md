# ❗ Stickymessage Notice

{% hint style="danger" %}
Waya is committed to providing a safe and respectful environment for all users. We do not support or tolerate any harmful or offensive content or language.
{% endhint %}

## What is this?

This is a feature that automatically sends a pre-set message every 6 seconds when there is no active conversation. The content of the **stickymessages are determined by the server admins and is not controlled by Waya.** We do not support or tolerate any harmful or offensive content or language.

## How to remove this button?

This is a notice to inform users that the stickymessage feature is enabled and determined by the server admins, for safety reasons and is not able to be removed on the free plan. However, the feature can be removed on the Enterprise plan. If you are interested in this option, please [visit our Enterprise page ](https://waya.one/enterprise)for more information.

## How do I disable this?

To disable the stickymessages feature, a server administrator can use the command `/stickymessages delete` command on the server. This will stop the automatic resending of the pre-set message.

## How can I have this too?

1. Install Waya on your server by going to [get.waya.one](https://get.waya.one).
2. Run `/stickymessages create` and follow through that embed.
3. 🎉 Done! Type some message to try it out.
